# TELEINFO ANDROID APP

This Android App uses data collected from [teleinfo-enphase-xev101-php-firebase
](https://github.com/vrobert78/teleinfo-enphase-xev101-php-firebase) and stored into [Google Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database).

The app reflects in near-realtime your electricity consumption and represents it using a gauge.

## This file is automatically generated by Android Studio.

# header note.
sdk.dir=/pathToYour/Android/Sdk
```
3. Open the project using the [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
4. Download your `google-service.json` that you'll find in parameters of your [Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)
5. Copy `google-service.json` in the app folder

### Security
Don't forget to set some rules on your Realtime Database. You can limit access to your Google Account after the first login, that will give you your UID in the project.
After that, you can use a rule like:
```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth.uid == 'youruid'",
    ".write": false
  }
}
```
